# Numerical_Methods_Project2
Solving a system of linear equations Ax = b using the block SOR method, where the matrix A(n x n) is of the form: <br> <br>
![](images/sample_matrix.jpg) <!-- --> <br><br>
where A<sub>i,j</sub>(p x p) and n = 3p. We assume that A<sub>1,1</sub> is symmetric and positively defined.
We will use the Cholesky-Banachiewicz (LDL<sup>T</sup>) method to solve appropriate systems of linear equations.
We will additionally determine the spectral radius of the iteration matrix for the block SOR method.
